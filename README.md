# AI Furniture Designer
 
A dynamic web application that allows users to generate a custom furniture landing page using AI. Users select their preferences for furniture type, budget, and style, and the application communicates with an AI backend (n8n and Gemini) to produce a unique, visually appealing webpage.

## Objectives
 
- Architect a client-server application with a PHP frontend and a server-side proxy.
- Interface with an external AI service (n8n/Gemini) for dynamic content generation.
- Solve Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues using a secure server-side proxy pattern.
- Hide sensitive API keys and webhook URLs from the client-side code.
- Implement a seamless, responsive user experience with clear loading states and asynchronous operations.

## Steps & Architecture
 
1.  **Frontend UI & Data Capture:**
    - The user interacts with a responsive form (`index.php`) built with HTML5 and Bootstrap.
    - Client-side JavaScript (`script.js`) captures the user's selections for furniture type, budget, and style upon form submission.
 
2.  **Client-Side Request to Proxy:**
    - Instead of calling the n8n webhook directly (which would expose the URL and cause CORS errors), the JavaScript sends a `fetch` request to a local PHP script: `generate.php`.
    - The user's selections are sent as a JSON payload in the request body.
 
3.  **Server-Side Proxy Logic (`generate.php`):** 
    - This PHP script acts as a secure backend proxy.
    - It retrieves the secret n8n webhook URL from a server environment variable (for production) or a local `config.local.php` file (for development).
    - It uses **cURL** to forward the exact request from the client to the actual n8n webhook.
 
4.  **n8n Workflow & AI Generation:**
    - The n8n workflow is triggered by the webhook call from the proxy.
    - It takes the user's preferences, passes them to the Gemini AI model, and instructs it to generate a complete HTML landing page.
    - The workflow returns the raw HTML as the response.
 
5.  **Response Handling & Dynamic Rendering:**
    - The `generate.php` proxy receives the HTML response from n8n and echoes it back to the client-side JavaScript.
    - The `fetch` call resolves, and the received HTML is dynamically injected into the result container, instantly displaying the generated page to the user.

## Commands & Code Snippet
 
### Local Development Setup:
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/janmaaarc/ai-powered-furniture-page.git
cd ai-powered-furniture

# 2. Create local configuration from the example
cp config.example.php config.local.php

# 3. (Edit config.local.php to add your webhook URL)

# 4. Run the local PHP server
php -S localhost:8000
```

### Key PHP Logic (Server-Side Proxy):
This script is the core of the backend, securely forwarding requests to the AI service.
```php
// /generate.php

// Retrieve the secret webhook URL from a server environment or local file
$webhookUrl = getenv('N8N_WEBHOOK_URL') ?: (require 'config.local.php');

// Get the raw POST data from the client-side JavaScript
$clientData = file_get_contents('php://input');

// Forward the request to the n8n webhook using cURL
$ch = curl_init($webhookUrl);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $clientData);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, ['Content-Type: text/plain']);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
$httpcode = curl_getinfo($ch, CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE);
curl_close($ch);

// Echo the response from n8n directly back to the client
http_response_code($httpcode);
echo $response;
```

## Notes / Lessons Learned
- **CORS & Security:** Directly calling a third-party webhook from the client is insecure and often blocked by browser CORS policies. The server-side proxy pattern is a robust solution that solves both problems by hiding the secret URL and ensuring all requests originate from the same domain.
- **Environment Variables:** Using `getenv()` for production and a local `.php` config file for development is a standard, flexible practice for managing sensitive data like API keys and URLs.
- **Asynchronous UX:** The combination of `async/await` in JavaScript and a responsive proxy ensures the UI remains active and provides clear feedback to the user during the AI generation process, which can take several seconds.
